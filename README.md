# Owl
[WIP] :owl: Owl is a pacman-like ReCT Package System CLI application :owl: 

Owl is a CLI application to easily install ReCT packages from https://rps.rect.ml.
Owl is designed after the Arch Linux package manager, pacman.
Packages can be installed, removed, updated, and more!

An example of basic owl usage is shown below:
```sh
$ owl -Syu      // Update the RPS packages
$ owl -S sys    // Install "sys" package from RPS
$ owl -R sys    // Remove "sys" package from RPS
```

## Installation

### Build from source

### AUR installation


## Usage
The Owl help menu can be shown by typing `owl` or `owl --help`. 
Commands take a flag, and if that flag requires and argument it follows the flag.
```shell
$ owl <flag> [argument]
```

### Flags
All the flags that Owl accepts are based on the pacmam package manager flags.
