# Contributing rules & guidelines
First of all, thank you for contributing to [Owl](https://github.com/hrszpuk/Owl] I really appricate any issues, pull requests, or discussions on the improvement of Owl!

Owl is a CLI application for managing ReCT packages!
Using Owl users can install, update, remove, and search packages both installed locally, and online.
Our aim to make managing ReCT packages as easy as possible, with as much functionality as our users need.

Before contributing to this project, please read the rules set out below. 
These rules are in place to keep the project organised.

## 1. Issues before Pull Request
Please create an issue and allow for discussion on an enhancement/bug rather than implement the solution and attempt to pull request the changes.
I believe it's best to have a thorough discussion on an idea, to understand why that idea is good, and how the idea could be implemented best, rather than
leaving collaborators in the dark and causing confusion.

## 2. Following GitHub Flow
[GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) is a branching strategy where for every feature being added to the project, you create a new branch.
By creating a new branch for said feature you are allowing other collaborators to see your work. 
Once the feature is complete you can request to merge the branch with main.
Your code will be reviewed and if it doesn't have any issue it will be merged.

## 3. Thorough commit messages
Please ensure commits are brief and meaningful. 
It's best to commit small changes at a time with meaningful desciption on what was changes, rather than commit large changes with little to no description at all.
If you are confused by this, please check the commit messages in main they should be a good example.

It's recommended commits have a meaningful title, description on changes made (optionally with link to related issue), and a `Changelog` of the changes made to the codebase.
[An example of a good commit message.](https://github.com/hrszpuk/Owl/commit/a264575227ea1782476f70f6233f8f17512cdce4)
